App Title
Yuvathees Wardrobe
Tagline: Coz U R Worth It
Purpose/Need Met
Yuvathees Wardrobe is a 4-year-old established brand with a growing international customer base. Until now, the brand has operated solely through social media (Facebook and Instagram), relying heavily on one-to-one communication. As interest grows, especially from new customers, there is a need for a central, accessible, and professional online space where people can learn about the brand, its story, offerings, and unique process.

This application aims to provide:
A clear, beautifully designed landing space for new visitors to understand what Yuvathees Wardrobe is all about.
An informational and interactive space that reduces repetitive manual communication for the brand owner.
A foundational starting point for expanding into a full-featured web application in the future.


User persona(s)
Brand Owner Persona
 Suganya Ponnusamy, the founder of Yuvathees Wardrobe, a brand built with passion and attention to detail. She frequently gets DMs and messages asking about her story, the process of sourcing and designing the attires, and what sets her brand apart. To avoid repeating herself and ensure that each customer receives the same level of insight, she wants a webpage she can share that answers common questions and presents her brand authentically beautiful.

New Customer Persona
 Ritu is a 34-year-old working Indian from Seattle who stumbles upon Yuvathees Wardrobe on Instagram. She loves the designs but doesn’t know if the brand is trustworthy or what makes it unique. Before reaching out via DM, she'd like to explore the story, process, and values behind the brand on a dedicated website.She is not just looking for an ecommerce site to place her orders, but an experience tailored to her needs. This is where this website comes to play.
